# Hotel Guest Feedback Form

A generic hotel guest feedback terminal to provide useful information to the hotel based on guests average score feedback for each department. Namely, the Front Desk, the Restaurant, the Spa and the Hotel Room.
This is useful information to the Hotel Marketing Department so that they can;
Know if the guests enjoyed the hotel and want to rebook, email a promotional discount to book a room directly.
Encourage guests to book directly with the hotel with email offers.
Know your customer and how they wish to be contacted in the future.

This is also very helpful to provide feedback to the operations department for improvement.
The Guest Feedback Form provides a way of monitoring on a daily basis how the hotel is viewed by the guests and averages the scores made by the guests for each department.
If the scores are particularly low then improvements to that department can be implemented.
Also if the hotel department has a high score the staff in those departments can be recognised for their hard work.

The Guest Feedback Form is currently paper based for the guests to complete upon check out. The form is short so that guests are not put off from completing the form. A hotel admin is then able to add the guest data to the terminal or with an access code view the guest data.
